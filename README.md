Inference on Amazon EKS:
In this session, we:
1. Learned about downloading model weights to the FSx for Lustre filesystem
2. Deployed a Mistral LLM model using vLLM with AWS Deep Learning Containers and RAM volume optimization
3. Tested the deployed model by sending an inference request to the service
